            <br>
            <p>Oh, St. Joseph, whose protection is so great, so strong,
                so prompt before the throne of God, I place in you all my
                interest and desires.Oh, St. Joseph, do assist me by your powerful
                intercession, and obtain for me from your divine Son all spiritual blessings, through Jesus Christ,
                our Lord. So that, having engaged here below your heavenly power, I may offer my thanksgiving
                and homage to the most loving of Fathers. Oh, St. Joseph, I never weary contemplating you and Jesus
                asleep in
                your arms; I dare not approach while He reposes near your heart. Press Him in my name and kiss His fine
                head for me and ask Him to
                return the kiss when I draw my dying breath. St. Joseph, Patron of departing souls- Pray for me.</p>

            <br>
            <p>I believe in God, the Fahter Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth. I believe
                in
                Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord. He was concieved by the power of the Holy Spirit and
                born of the Virgin Mary. He suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died, and was buried. He
                descended into heaven
                and is seated at the right hand of the Father. He will come again to judge the living and the dead.<br>
                I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Holy Catholic Church, the Communion of Saints, the forgiveness of
                sins, the
                resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting. Amen! </p>

            <p>Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name. Thy Kingdom come. 
             Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our
                trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver
                us from evil. Amen!
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 30px; color: red;">GLORY BE</p>
            <p> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit. As it was the beginning, is now 
                and will be ever. Amen!

            <p>O my Jesus, forgive us our sins, save us our sins, save us from the fires of hell, and lead all souls
                to heaven, especially those who most need your mercy.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 30px; color: red;">HAIL MARY</p>
            <p>Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with you. Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit 
                of your womb, Jesus. Holy Mry, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death. Amen!

            <p>Hail, Holy Queen Mother of Mercy. Hail, our life, our sweetness, and our hope. To you do we cry, poor banished
                children of Eve. To you do we send up our sighs, mourning and weeping in this valley of tears. Turn then, 
                most gracious Advocate, your eyes of mercy toward us, and after this exile, show unto us the blessed fruit of 
                your womb, Jesus. O clement, O loving, O sweet Virgin Mary.
